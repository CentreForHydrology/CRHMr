# CRHMr
This package is pronounced 'Krimmer' in honour of my wife's family.
The CRHMr functions are used with the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform, which is was developed at the Centre for Hydrology at the University of Saskatchewan. CRHM is available from http://www.usask.ca/hydrology/CRHM.php.

Functions are provided to create time series of forcing meteorological data, read and aggregate CRHM output, set model run parameters, and to run the CRHM program, on Windows, OSX or Linux.

There are also functions for gap removal, infilling and imputation of time series data, which may be useful for other models.
