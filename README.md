# CRHMr
This package is pronounced 'Krimmer' in honour of my wife's family.
The CRHMr functions are used to create time series of forcing meteorological
data for the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform. Functions are
also provided to read and aggregate CRHM output.
CRHMr functions are provided to set model run parameters, and to run the CRHM program, on Windows, OSX or Linux.
